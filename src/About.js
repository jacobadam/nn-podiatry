                I qualified as a chiropodist at the Northern College of
                Chiropody, Salford (now Salford University). Post-qualification,
                I lectured at the college before relocating to Liverpool. Since
                1979, I have operated a private practice in South Liverpool, as
                well as various other roles including being employed as an NHS
                podiatrist for many years, a podiatrist for ICI in Runcorn and
                Widnes (1981-1985), and as the podiatrist for Liverpool Football
                Club (1991-1994). From 2000 to 2017, I managed the Community
                Podiatry Team for the NHS in Liverpool, overseeing the delivery
                of quality podiatric services. Currently, I work part-time for
                St.Helens Primary Care Network (NHS) as well as carrying out
                private work in my Liverpool Practice.
