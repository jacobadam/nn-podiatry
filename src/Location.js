          The surgery is next door but one to the Weatherspoons Pub on the
          Childwall Fiveways roundabout (formerly the Childwall Fiveways pub).
          It is opposite Grosvenor Court and a small group of shops (including
          Elif restaurant).

          Parking is sometimes available on the drive outside the surgery,
          otherwise parking is available in the pub car park (Please note that
          the pub car park is "pay and display" car park. The charge is 50p).
