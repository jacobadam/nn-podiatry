                      Podiatry (or chiropody) is the medical speciality of
                      caring for feet. (The terms podiatry and chiropody are
                      interchangeable, although there are a growing number of
                      surgical podiatrists in the UK who actually carry out
                      ambulatory foot surgery on patients to treat conditions
                      such as bunions and hammer toes).
                    </p>

                      Podiatrists treat conditions on the feet such as hard
                      skin, corns, nails (and in particular, are specialists in
                      treating ingrowing toenails which can be cured by way of a
                      minor surgical procedure under a local anaesthetic - a
                      procedure that can be carried out in the surgery and takes
                      less than an hour). Podiatrists also treat verrucae
                      (plantar warts) although the present advice of the BMA
                      (British Medical Association) is to not treat verrucae
                      unless they are causing pain. Painful verrucae can still
                      be treated by podiatrists.

                      Podiatrists also care for the feet of diabetics, whether
                      insulin or non-insulin dependent. Due to the effect of
                      diabetes on the feet, a diabetic is at greater risk of
                      suffering from peripheral vascular disease (circulatory
                      problems) and they can also suffer from peripheral
                      neuropathy (when there is a reduction in the sensation in
                      the feet). If not cared for, diabetics run a high risk of
                      serious foot problems, many of which can be prevented by
                      regular podiatry treatment.
